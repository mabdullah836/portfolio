      <p>
        Hi there! I’m Abdullah, a passionate full-stack developer with a love
        for creating intuitive and engaging web applications. With expertise in
        the MERN stack, I thrive on building seamless digital experiences that
        not only meet your needs but also exceed your expectations.
        <br />
        <br />
         My journey
        into the tech world began with a fascination for problem-solving and
        innovation. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in both front-end and
        back-end development, enabling me to bring your ideas to life from
        concept to completion.
        <br />
        <br />
         When I'm not coding, you’ll find me exploring the
        latest tech trends, working on personal projects, or diving into a good
        book. I believe in the power of collaboration and am always excited to
        connect with fellow creators and visionaries. 
        <br />
